# DS2Fix — status & roadmap

## ✅ Done (v0.1.7)
- **Save content-footprint bypass** — the v1.0 blocker, solved. DS2 stamps every save with a `content_crc`
  (a hash of the installed resource set) and silently HIDES + refuses saves whose crc no longer matches the
  install; re-patching the tank or installing a data mod changes the crc, so existing saves would "disappear/
  reappear". `IsContentCrcAcceptable` (FUN_004139d0) is now forced to always accept (both the list-summary and
  load-summary readers go through it; MP content-matching is a separate path, untouched). **Proven live:** the
  Thomas party listed *and* loaded into gameplay after a real footprint change (tank crc `8a7b6adb`→`e67d647d`)
  that would otherwise have hidden it.
- **Frontend 3D preview models now render in their panels** (object_view offset, was problem #3). The
  main-menu Continue party model and the Single-Player hero-select paperdoll used to draw at the native
  800×600 top-left corner while their panels scaled to 1920; the viewport rect is now scaled with the panel
  so the model sits on its pedestal. Unblocked by two earlier fixes: wined3d (scaling no longer blanks it) and
  the footprint bypass (the frontend `dir.lqd22` recompile no longer hides the party list). Verified live on
  the main menu + Choose-Hero screen.

## ✅ Done (v0.1.6)
- Widescreen HUD anchoring, native 16:9 menus, frontend + ESC-menu scaling, configurable UI scale/res.
- All campaign difficulties unlocked; data-mod support (content CRC disabled); non-resizable window;
  version label + in-game overlay; Multiplayer button re-enabled (LAN + direct-IP).
- **wined3d render fix** — DS2's 3D `object_view` viewports (Journal cloth map, character/inventory
  paperdoll, hero-creation preview) render correctly at widescreen. (DXVK blanks them; we force wined3d.)
- gamescope no longer lingers after the game exits (supervised launcher).
- **Large-Address-Aware (2GB→4GB)** — PE-header bit, so HD-texture mods don't OOM-crash.
- **Uncapped framerate** — `maxfps` launch arg (default 120; `--maxfps 0` = uncapped).
- **Optional mod installer** — `ds2fix mods list/install/remove` + GUI section; non-bundled, SHA512-verified,
  finds the download in common folders, tracks installs for clean removal. Registered: #26 Storage Vault,
  #29 HD Textures.
- Save auto-backup + install pinning; cross-platform CLI + GUI + PyInstaller packaging; unit tests (`tests/`).

## 🟡 Open / optional
1. **Test normal co-op multiplayer** — host a game + join via **LAN** and **direct-IP** (the MP button is
   already unlocked; DS2 MP is peer-to-peer over DirectPlay8). *No dedicated server* — DS2 has no such
   concept (host-based P2P), so that idea is dropped.
2. **Re-enable the Journal → Map cloth-map scaling** — now that frontend object_view scaling is proven to
   work on wined3d, re-test the backend map targets (currently commented out in `_target_list`) and confirm
   the cloth map scales cleanly (the "out of line" symptom was the same object_view offset just fixed).
3. **Scale in-game panels** (inventory / character / spellbook / trade paperdoll) — the same object_view
   scaling should now place the in-game paperdoll correctly; currently native/small. Verify + enable.
4. **Re-test a newer DXVK** — if a current build renders the object_views, switch back for its performance.
5. **Windows end-to-end test** — patcher core is cross-platform; verify a real Windows run.

## ⛔ Won't do / N/A
- **#27 Aranna Legacy**, **#163 HD Cutscenes** — Broken World (v2.3) only; install is base DS2.
- **#119 Enhanced UI HD** — bundles Cristi80 Resolution Fix, which conflicts with our launch-param res.
- **Dedicated MP server** — DS2 MP is peer-to-peer/host-based; no dedicated server exists.
- **Pre-rendered cutscenes** stay 4:3 (engine limit; would need re-encoding the video files).

## The "done" line
**v1.0 reached.** The two things that stood between "works" and "robust" — the save content-footprint bypass
and the frontend 3D preview offset — are both fixed and verified live. DS2 is fully playable and widescreen:
working + always-visible saves (re-patch/mod safe), native 16:9 menus with correctly-placed preview models,
journal map, LAA-backed HD-texture/storage mods, and an uncapped framerate. Everything left (#1–#5) is
optional polish or verification — nothing blocks a v1.0 tag.
